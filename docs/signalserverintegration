# SignalServer Integration

QCTools now offers SignalServer Integration, allowing users to automatically or manually upload QCTools Reports as they are created by the application. 

Once signalserver has been properly installed, and you’ve created a personal account, you’ll need to connect it to QCTools. You can do so by clicking on the menu bar at the top left of the QCTools screen and selecting Preferences (shortcut: #,). Under the signalserver tab, fill in the following: the unique URL of your signalserver app, and your User name and password. 

### How does signalserver work?

Files can be uploaded to signalserver in a number of ways. If QCTools reports have been created in batches (via the command line and FFmpeg, or python scripts found here and here), they can uploaded directly to signalserver. 

There are four steps to signalserver quality control analysis:

Upload your QCTools Reports to signalserver, via either the QCTools GUI or the signalserver “File Upload” page;
Form a group of files to be cross-checked;
Create a policy (or multiple policies) to test your group of files;
Process the policy, and review outliers. 

### SignalServer Installation

Detailed signalserver installation instructions can be found here (link). Installation will vary based upon your specific technical infrastructure. Though designed for a Linux server environment, signalserver can be installed on a local computer.
