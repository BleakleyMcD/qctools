<h1>Getting Started with QC Tools</h1>

<h2 style="color:blue">What is QC Tools?</h2>
<p>
QC Tools (Quality Control Tools for Video Preservation) is a software tool that helps users analyze and understand their digitized video files. With QC Tools, archives and other institutions can check files for corruptions before and after transferring to a digital format. The goal is simple: to cut down the time it takes to perform high-quality video preservation and direct time towards preservation issues that are solvable, for example identifying tapes that would benefit from a second transfer, saving not only the precious time of preservationists and institutional resources, but giving collections a necessary advantage in the bigger race against time to preserve their significant cultural artifacts. QC Tools incorporates archival standards and best practices for reformatting and capturing metadata that enables the long-term preservation and of and access to the original artifact, the digital object, and the associated catalog record.
</p>
<br/>
<h2 style="color:blue">Who can benefit from using QC Tools (and how)?</h2>
<p>
Potential users of the quality control tools include specialists and non-specialists:
</p>

<li>Archivists and librarians</li>
<p>
Moving image archives that collect digital video may receive digitized content with undiagnosed playback problems and errors. QC Tools can help archivists understand what is wrong with certain files and then take steps to correct or explain these errors. Archivists need to be able to trust that the digitized files are up to a certain level of quality, and have quantifiable data to prove it. QC Tools allows archivists to not be required to rely on visual queues for the acknowledgment of problematic video quality. 
<br /><br />
QC Tools will benefit not only moving image archives but paper archives that include video collections that may fall into neglect. The rapid rate of deterioration makes the preservation of magnetic media-based archival elements of foremost import when deciding on preservation strategies; however, because the knowledge base is so specialized, paper and photographic archivists lack a way to evaluate digitization measures. QC Tools will make it easier and more approachable for these archives to preserve and maintain digitized moving image materials.
</p>

<li>Media asset managers and media production coordinators</li>
<p>
	Users working in this industry can use QC Tools to perform quality checks on incoming media, as well as existing stored media. Work on large video collections can be done in-house and via spot-checking, instead of outsourcing much of the material. Furthermore, quality of video can be assured suitable for broadcast environments.
<br/><br/>
For example, if a production company is working with editing footage, it is better to know early on if there is a problem with any of the video files, so that they can be retransferred or discarded from use.</p>

<li>Preservation technicians and moving image digitization specialists</li>
<p>
	Preservation technicians and moving image digitization specialists need to maintain a high level of quality for all materials they are processing. QC Tools assists with these projects. Instead of having to do a full visual check of video files to monitor for errors, technicians can use QC Tools to identify problem areas for more efficient spot-checking. When integrated into a digitization workflow, QC Tools can reduce time and increase the discovery of errors.
<br/><br />
For example, using QC Tools regularly to verify audiovisual artifacts caused by VHS <a href="http://preservation.bavc.org/artifactatlas/index.php/Head_Switching_Noise">Head Switching Noise</a> or a U-Matic machine's <a href="http://preservation.bavc.org/artifactatlas/index.php/Video_Head_Clog">Video Head Clog</a> can prevent the need for additional transfers due to a machine that needs cleaning. 
</p>

<li>Artists and curators</li>
<p>
Artists digitizing their work, or having their work digitized for them, may not have the background knowledge necessary to understand why their videos look the way they do. QC Tools can help artists interpret these errors so the necessary steps can be taken to keep digitized video looking as close to as they originally did. 
<br/><br />
For example, a performance artist may have stored her performances on VHS tapes in a non-ideal location, resulting in some damage to the magnetic tape's structure. She is working with a friend to digitize the tapes, but they keep noticing errors. However, not expecting problems with the tapes, they have no budget for paying an expert to explain and fix the problem. Using QC Tools, the artist can assess the collection, pinpoint errors, understand what the problems are, and come up with solutions without requiring outsourcing of all of the tapes.
</p>

<li>Historians and collections managers</li>
<p>
Historians and collection managers that do not usually work with audiovisual historical documents may not know how to proceed with preserving video formats, and additionally not have the standard tools that may be found in archives equipped to handle audiovisual materials. QC Tools can work in lieu of access to expensive proprietary software
<br/><br />
For example, a small state historical society may have a collection of tapes, but because they are a small staff and cannot afford to outsource digitization, the tapes have been neglected. If the staff is able to get the equipment to digitize the tapes in-house, QC Tools can help them diagnose issues and make the digitization process less intimidating while ensuring high quality digital files.
