            QCTools Recording Feature
        </h1>
        <p>
            QCTools includes an experimental recording feature funded by the [Knight Foundation Prototype Fund](http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/201449123/). The recording features utilize Blackmagic's SDK to read audiovisual data from a compatible Decklink device and then create a QuickTime file with such data via FFmpeg. Currently the feature is experimental and provided for testing purposes only.
        </p>
        <p>
            When QCTools is opened on a computer that has a supporting decklink device attachment a new Recording icon and toolbar menu will appear within the QCTools interface. Clicking the icon will open a layout designed to set up recording instructions and the specifications of the resulting file. Options include starting and ending time of the recording as well as video bit depth, audio bit depth, audio channel count, and video codec.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the recording is initiated QCTools will analyze the audiovisual frames as it does when processing opened video files. As video is recording QCTool's Graph and Playback layouts may be used to review material as it is being recorded to a file.
        </p>
        <p>Please feel free to use the [QCTools issue tracker](https://github.com/bavc/qctools/issues/) to document recording issues while noticing the hardware involved, recording settings, and expected outcome.
